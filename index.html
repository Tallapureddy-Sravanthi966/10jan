    <p>Tigers are native to Asia, but their range today is much smaller than it used to be, and includes South-east Asia, India, western China, and some parts of Russia, with breeding populations present in Bhutan, Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Russia and Nepal.

        In terms of habitat, tigers inhabit a range of environments, but generally prefer areas with dense cover, like forests, with access to water and plenty of prey. Dens are positioned in secluded areas such as in caves, among dense vegetation or in hollow trees.</p>

 <p>This two-subspecies proposal was reaffirmed in 2015 by a comprehensive analysis of morphological, ecological and molecular traits of all putative tiger subspecies using a combined approach. The authors proposed recognition of only two subspecies, namely P. t. tigris comprising the Bengal, Malayan, Indochinese, South Chinese, Siberian and Caspian tiger populations of continental Asia, and P. t. sondaica comprising the Javan, Bali and Sumatran tiger populations of the Sunda Islands. The continental nominate subspecies P. t. tigris constitutes two clades: a northern clade composed of the Siberian and Caspian tiger populations, and a southern clade composed of all other mainland populations.</p>
